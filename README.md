# VC bots finder browser extension

## Getting started

Create a project based on this boilerplate.
Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies.

```
$ yarn
```

1. Open Chrome.
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable _Developer mode_.
4. Click _Load unpacked_.
5. Select the `dist` directory.
